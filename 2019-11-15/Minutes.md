# Minutes

## Tango Source Distribution

[9.3.4-rc2](https://github.com/tango-controls/TangoSourceDistribution/releases/tag/9.3.4-rc2) has been released.

**Action - All**: Test [9.3.4-rc2](https://github.com/tango-controls/TangoSourceDistribution/releases/tag/9.3.4-rc2) release.

## cppTango News

A new branch 9.3-backports has been created to provide bug fixes and small improvements for the cppTango 9.3 compatible versions.

### Require newer C++ compilers

In the cppTango project we would like to move to C++11/C++14.
For this we would require newer minimum compiler versions.
It would be interesting to hear which old OS versions still need to be supported.

C++11 full support in gcc 4.8
C++14 full support in gcc 5.0

C++11 is a requirement for next year or so, C++14 is nice to have but can wait some time

### Require newer cmake version. 
As we move to more C++11 features, it would avoid a lot of additional work if we could use a newer cmake
version which has the required checks builtin. 
From reading [[1]] it seems 3.7 would be good already, this was shipped with debian stretch (oldstable).
Older distros can just download/compile a newer cmake version version as we do now for debian wheezy [[2]]. 

### cppTango next release number
cppTango next release number (9.4 or 10.0?) [#593](https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango/pull/593)

Preference is for 9.4
Still the issue with SONAME needs to be solved. Do we have to change it for 9.4 stated that is not binary compatible?
The soname going to be tango94 (TB).

### Stalled Pull Requests

- Question raised in [#555](https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango/pull/555) (Fix crash during alarm state evaluation if attribute value is not set)

Decided to fix the crash but do not modify automagically device State and/or Status, see mail exchange.

- Questions raised in [#504](https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango/pull/504) (PR to fix #368): Pushing events for State and Status with quality factor and timestamp.
- [#620](https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango/issues/620), [#540](https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango/issues/540) 
and [#592](https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango/issues/592) follow-up?

Check 692 and 540 with Giacomo

- [#551](https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango/pull/551)) to implement the 
server_init_hook() feature. Changes were requested by Thomas Braun.
- [#480](https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango/pull/480): DevEnum Support for commands

Reynald Bourtembourg created [cppTango#552](https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango/pull/552) to fix bug which could lead 
to a crash when reading a forwarded state attribute. This PR needs to be reviewed too.

## JTango News

An issue has been observed at the ESRF with some Java GUIs subscribing to a big number of events.
We observed that the first event subscription ZMQ message(s) could be dropped silently by jeromq (not sent on the network) 
when trying to subscribe to an attribute on a remote device server. This issue occurs after a big number of event subscriptions and 
when subscribing to an attribute of a remote device server which had not been contacted yet by jeromq for this GUI. 
A fix has been found by setting the SendHwm to 0 on the ZMQ sockets used on the subscriber side.
Here is the commit fixing this issue: https://github.com/tango-controls/JTango/commit/b00043a5df6bd6b4bd95e2ce35c92b871f2e99a7

Travis for openjdk 7 failed. This needs to be investigated.
